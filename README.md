# flux-capacitor


 Flux-capacitor is a time saver. It is an scaffolding for webapps that contains a client side admin app made in AngularJS and a server side app made in Loopback framework (node). 

 We are already using it in production for small projects but unfortunatelly the code is quite a mess right now and we think it is not ready for being published. The plan is to make it public in a few weeks in "alpha" mode and invite everybody to help us develop it.

 Some goals we will be persuing then are:
 
 - Creating a CLI.
 - Tidying up the form automatization tool.
 - Analize File storage strategies.
 - Some improvements to the loopback framework itself.
